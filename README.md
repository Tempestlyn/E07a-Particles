Within main1.py, instead of chosing from smoke, fire, rain, or explosion particles, I went with snowing particles. They initially fall with a slight randomness to their velocity and direction, and then gradually "sway" to the left to simulate wind. I also made the particles able to stack like snow. However, this makes the window run slow after a bit.
